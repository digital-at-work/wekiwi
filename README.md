For setting up wekiwi for development and customization, please refer to the individual README files located in the respective folders: the frontend and the backend (ai-search-and-feature-extraction). These files provide instructions for configuring and running each component independently.

A consolidated README file will be added to the project root in the future, which will also include comprehensive guidelines for setting up a productive wekiwi instance including the Directus content management system as part of the wekiwi setup process. Stay tuned for updates!

Documentation on how to interact with a configured wekiwi instance via its API will soon be available in this repository's wiki. This will include examples demonstrated with our SaaS wekiwi instance, accessible at https://wekiwi.de. For further insights and updates, donâ€™t forget to visit our blog at https://news.wekiwi.de.
Thank you for your patience.
